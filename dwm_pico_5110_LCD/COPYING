Project: dwm_pico_5110_lcd
Description: 5110 LCD C library for Raspberry Pi Pico.
Copyright 2023 - 2023 M.Kusiak (timax)

2. Previous authors and copyrights

This library is based on Nokia-LCD5110-HAL library for STM32 devices.
Link to the original source code: https://github.com/Zeldax64/Nokia-LCD5110-HAL

The author of original library is github user Zeldax64, Caio Rodrigo.
Link to the author's github page: https://github.com/Zeldax64?tab=repositories

Source library is based on work done by:
1) Tilen Majerle's
    @website	http://stm32f4-discovery.com
    @link	http://stm32f4-discovery.com/pcd8544-nokia-33105110-lcd-stm32f429-discovery-library/
    This library was build for STM devices, but it doesn't run on HAL.
    Tilen also has a great site about STM32.

2) RinkyDinkElectronic's
    @website http://www.RinkyDinkElectronics.com/
    This library was built to control 5110 for Arduino.
...as it was specified, by the author, Caio Rodrigo.

3. Changes made

Original library was converted to be used with Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK, rather than STM32 based boards.
The library now uses SPI interface to interact with the LCD display.
Various functions have been added to extend library's capabilities like: drawing circles, lines, triangles or filing shapes with color.
Some of the functions and descriptions needed refactoring due to switching platforms.
"Documentation like" comment was removed from source files.

4. 3rd party and non-gpl licenses

This library was made to be used with Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK, and uses methods provided by that software.
SDK is shared under BSD 3 license.
